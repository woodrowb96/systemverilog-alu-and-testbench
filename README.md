# systemverilog-alu-and-testbench

This repository contains an alu, designed to operate in a riscv pipeline.

It also contains a test bench which performs a directed test on the alu.

Both the alu and test bench are written in systemverilog.

Alu design code can be found in the rtl_src folder.

Test bench code can be found in the tb folder.

vsim_comp and vsim_sim are shell scripts used to compile and simulate the sv files using modelsim.
